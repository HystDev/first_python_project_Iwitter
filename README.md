# first_python_project_Twitter


### THIS WILL BE A PROJECT TO LEARN TO ### 
### WORK WITH TWITTER-API2.0 IN PYTHON ###
### THEREFORE I WANT TO CREATE CODE TO ###
### SCAN TWEETS OF SINGLE USERS WITHIN ###
###   A PYTHON SCRIPTED APPLICATION    ###

###  FIRST IDEA IS TO TAKE TWEETS AS   ###
### STRING WHICH WILL BE SPLIT IN ITS  ###
###  SINGLE WORDS AND SEARCH THE WEB   ###
###   FOR EACH OF THIS WORD-STRINGS    ###
### TO RETURN SEARCH RESULTS OR EVEN   ###
### PASS THEM OVER TO A SQL-DATABASE   ###
